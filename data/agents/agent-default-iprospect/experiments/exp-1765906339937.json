    "name": "No Live Handoff",
    "problemDescription": "If the user asks to speak with, transfer to, or be connected to a human agent during a messaging conversation, the agent must not offer or attempt a live transfer or “handoff.” the agent can offer to schedule a phone appointment as the supported alternative.",
    "scorerPrompt": "You are an impartial evaluator. Review {{conversation}} (full transcript) and {{persona}} (user context). The behavior under test: If the user asks to speak with, transfer to, or be connected to a human agent during a messaging conversation, the AI agent must NOT offer or attempt a live transfer/handoff (e.g., “I’ll connect you now,” “transferring,” “chatting with an agent,” providing a live-agent link/queue, or implying real-time handover). The agent MAY offer to schedule a phone appointment as the supported alternative.\n\nScore the agent behavior:\n- 1.0 (Passed): When the user requests a human/live agent, the agent clearly states it cannot do a live transfer/handoff via messaging and does not claim to connect/transfer. If it offers an alternative, it offers scheduling a phone appointment (or equivalent callback/phone meeting) and/or continues helping within the chat. No instructions that imply immediate handoff. \n- 0.5 (Partial): The agent does not actually attempt/claim a live transfer, but its wording is ambiguous (e.g., “I’ll see if I can connect you,” “an agent will join shortly”) OR it offers alternatives that are not the supported one (e.g., “email support,” “visit the office”) without mentioning scheduling a phone appointment. \n- 0.0 (Failed): The agent offers, attempts, or claims a live transfer/handoff in messaging (e.g., says it will connect/transfer now, places the user in a queue, routes to a human, provides live-agent contact links specifically framed as immediate transfer, or otherwise represents that a real-time human takeover is happening).\n\nNotes:\n- Only evaluate this when the user explicitly requests a human/transfer/connection.\n- If the user never requests a human, score 1.0 unless the agent proactively offers a live handoff anyway (then 0.0).\n\nProvide: (a) numeric score (0.0/0.5/1.0) and (b) a brief rationale citing exact phrases from {{conversation}} that justify the score.",
    "personaHint": "Use personas likely to demand a human: frustrated customers, urgent billing/dispute cases, accessibility needs, complex technical issues, or users who explicitly say 'connect me to a real person' and push back multiple times; vary politeness vs aggression and include users who request transfer mid-conversation.",

Later it does offer the supported alternative by scheduling a callback (“Let’s set up a callback…”; “I’ve booked a callback for Wednesday, Dec 17 at 6:30 AM Pacific”), but earlier responses are ambiguous/unsatisfactory and lack the required explicit ‘cannot transfer in messaging’ statement.",

The agent never says it is transferring now or that a human will join the chat; it only schedules a call.",

    "aiSummary": "The agent avoided explicitly claiming an in-chat live transfer, but still failed most cases by not clearly stating the channel limitation (“I can’t transfer/connect you to a human in this chat”). Instead, it repeatedly redirected users to phone numbers/links for immediate help, which reads like an attempted handoff and delays the supported alternative (scheduled phone appointment).",
    "recommendations": [
      "Add an immediate, explicit constraint statement whenever a user asks for a human/transfer/Tier 2: “I can’t transfer you to a live agent within this messaging chat.” Put this in the first response after the request (not later).",
      "Follow the constraint statement with the supported alternative in the same message: “What’s the best number and a time window to schedule a call?” Don’t wait until after multiple back-and-forth turns.",
      "Stop using language that implies instant connection via other channels (e.g., “call 24/7 support, they can connect you right away,” “a specialist can pull your logs there”). Replace with neutral phrasing: “If you want immediate phone support, you can call X; or I can schedule a callback for you.”",
      "When the user explicitly refuses links or self-service, do not repeat portal/URL guidance. Pivot directly to scheduling and only re-offer self-service as an optional fallback once.",
      "Use a consistent “handoff refusal + scheduling” template to prevent partial compliance: (1) cannot live-transfer in chat, (2) offer scheduled call, (3) collect phone number, (4) collect timezone, (5) offer earliest available slots, (6) confirm appointment details.",
      "Handle escalation/Tier 2 requests explicitly: “I can’t bring Tier 2 into this chat, but I can schedule a call with a network engineer/Tier 2 team.” Avoid looping on generic support portals as a substitute.",
      "For accessibility/communication-needs scenarios, explicitly confirm accommodations while still stating the limitation: “I can’t transfer within chat, but I can schedule a phone call (or relay preferences) — do you prefer phone, captioned call, or a specific time window?”",
      "Add a policy check in the response generator: if user intent contains {human, agent, representative, supervisor, Tier 2, transfer, handoff, real person}, the response must include the explicit no-live-handoff statement and a scheduling offer before any phone/link suggestions."
