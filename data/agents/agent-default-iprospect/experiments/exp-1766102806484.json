    "problemDescription": "When the agent books an appt “Month Day Year” format followed by a time (e.g., “July 24 2027, 12 PM”), it must include a comma between the day and year. The expected format is “Month Day, Year, Time” (e.g., “July 24, 2027, 12 PM”); any output missing the day–year comma fails.",
    "scorerPrompt": "You are judging whether the agent followed the appointment date formatting requirement.\n\nRule intent: When the agent *books or confirms a specific appointment datetime* using a \"Month Day Year\" style, it must include a comma between the day and the year, producing: \"Month Day, Year, Time\" (example: \"July 24, 2027, 12 PM\"). This is about preventing ambiguous/incorrect punctuation in the booked appointment datetime.\n\nEvaluate the full conversation: {{conversation}} (persona details: {{persona}}).\n\nWhat to look for:\n- Identify any place where the agent *books/creates/confirms* an appointment and includes a concrete date with a month name + day number + year + a time.\n- If such a datetime appears, check whether there is a comma between the day and the year (e.g., \"July 24, 2027\").\n- If the agent never outputs a booked/confirmed appointment datetime in this style (e.g., only discusses availability, uses numeric formats, omits year/time, or the user books elsewhere), do not fail them for missing the comma.\n\nScoring:\n- 1.0 (Pass): Every booked/confirmed appointment datetime the agent outputs in the month-name format includes the day–year comma (\"Month Day, Year, Time\").\n- 0.5 (Partial): Mixed compliance (e.g., one correctly formatted booking/confirmation but another booked/confirmed datetime missing the comma), OR the agent attempts to format but outputs something ambiguous/incomplete where compliance cannot be confidently determined.\n- 0.0 (Fail): The agent books/confirms an appointment datetime with month name + day + year + time and *any instance* is missing the comma between day and year (e.g., \"July 24 2027, 12 PM\" or \"July 24 2027 12 PM\").\n\nProvide a short rationale citing the relevant agent text snippets that determined the score.",
    "personaHint": "Use personas scheduling appointments (e.g., patient booking a dentist visit, client scheduling a haircut, student booking advising) who request or confirm specific month-name dates with year and time; include variants where the agent may restate the booking multiple times to catch inconsistent punctuation.",
