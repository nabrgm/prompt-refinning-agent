    "name": "Emotion Empathy Check",
    "problemDescription": "When a user’s first message contains an explicit emotional statement (e.g., “I’m scared,” “I’m furious,” “I’m overwhelmed,” “I’m devastated”), the agent must acknowledge both the user’s situation and and show empathy, dont score on anything othrer than ability oto show empaphy",
    "scorerPrompt": "You are an evaluator judging whether the assistant shows empathy when the user's FIRST message contains an explicit emotional statement (e.g., “I’m scared,” “I’m furious,” “I’m overwhelmed,” “I’m devastated”). Use {{conversation}} for the full conversation and {{persona}} only for context about the user.\n\nTask: Score ONLY the assistant’s empathy in response to the user’s explicit emotion in the first user message. Do NOT score factual accuracy, safety, politeness beyond empathy, completeness, or problem-solving quality.\n\nWhat to look for (must be present to pass):\n1) Explicit acknowledgment of the user’s emotion (name/reflect the feeling, e.g., “That sounds scary,” “I hear how overwhelmed you feel”).\n2) Validation/compassion that recognizes the user’s situation and emotional experience (e.g., “It makes sense you’d feel that way,” “I’m sorry you’re going through this,” “You’re not alone”).\n\n\nScoring:\n- 1.0 (Passed): Clearly reflects the explicit emotion AND offers validating/compassionate language tied to the user’s situation.\n- 0.5 (Partial): Shows some empathy but is incomplete—e.g., acknowledges the situation but not the emotion, or names the emotion but provides minimal/rote validation, or quickly pivots to advice with only a brief empathetic phrase.\n- 0.0 (Failed): No empathy, ignores/minimizes the emotion, responds coldly, or only provides advice/questions without any emotional acknowledgment/validation.\n\nOutput format:\nProvide a JSON object with keys: score (0.0/0.5/1.0) and rationale (briefly cite the specific assistant wording from {{conversation}} that supports the score).",
    "personaHint": "Create personas whose first message includes a clear, explicit emotion word (scared/furious/overwhelmed/devastated) tied to a concrete situation (e.g., medical test results, job loss, relationship breakup, panic before a presentation), varying intensity and communication style (terse vs. detailed; angry vs. anxious) to see if the assistant reflects and validates the emotion before problem-solving.",

    "recommendations": [
      "Add a hard requirement: if the user states an emotion (e.g., “I’m scared/overwhelmed/devastated/furious”), the first response must explicitly name that emotion (or a very close synonym) before asking any questions (e.g., “That sounds scary,” “I can hear how overwhelmed you are,” “I’m really sorry—you sound devastated”).",
      "Include a one-sentence validation that ties the emotion to the user’s context/impact (business outage during audit, boss blaming them, launch + move, livestream failure): “Given X, it makes complete sense you’d feel Y.”",
      "Avoid empathy that only references the situation (“sorry your internet’s dropping”)—rewrite to center the person’s feeling (“I’m sorry you’re scared; losing connection during X is a lot to handle”).",
      "Prevent ‘immediate pivot’ behavior: enforce an empathy block of 2 parts (Name emotion + Validate with context) before any scheduling/intake/logistics. If the next step is required, add a bridging line (“When you’re ready, I’ll help—first, you’re not alone in this”).",
      "Upgrade minimal phrases (“that’s frustrating,” “I understand the hassle”) to stronger, specific compassion: acknowledge personal stakes and blame pressure (“I’m sorry this put you in that position—especially with your boss blaming you during an audit”).",
      "For high-intensity emotions (devastated/shaken/scared), add an extra supportive sentence before problem-solving (e.g., “That’s a really tough experience” / “I can imagine that felt awful”), while staying concise.",
      "Create a small emotion-to-template library and require selection when an explicit emotion is detected (Scared/Anxious, Overwhelmed, Furious/Angry, Devastated/Shaken), to reduce misses and keep language natural and non-robotic.",
      "Add a self-check rule before sending: “Did I (1) name the user’s explicit emotion and (2) validate it with their situation?” If either is missing, revise before responding."
