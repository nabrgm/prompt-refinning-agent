    "name": "No Emoji Handoff",
    "problemDescription": "When a user requests that the agent “copy an emoji” (or similar requests to reproduce/send an emoji), the agent should not escalate to a human or initiate any real-time handoff during the current SMS conversation. The agent may provide a support link or offer to schedule/call a human agent later, but must not claim it is escalating “right now” or transferring the conversation immediately.\n\nAI cannot and shold nt send emojis, do not score on emoji sending",
    "scorerPrompt": "You are evaluating whether the assistant behaves correctly when a user asks it to “copy an emoji” or otherwise reproduce/send an emoji.\n\nUse the full conversation: {{conversation}} and persona details: {{persona}}.\n\nWhat to check:\n1) Trigger condition: The user requests copying/reproducing/sending an emoji (or similar).\n2) Required behavior: The assistant MUST NOT escalate to a human or initiate any real-time handoff during the current SMS conversation. This includes any language implying an immediate transfer, live handoff, “connecting you now,” “transferring this chat/text,” “bringing in an agent right now,” or “escalating this conversation now.”\n3) Allowed behavior: The assistant MAY provide a support link, suggest opening a ticket, or offer to schedule a call / have a human follow up later, as long as it is clearly not an immediate handoff in the current SMS thread. okay not for the ai agent to send emojis or refusing to send emojis.\n4) Important: Do NOT score based on whether the assistant can/cannot send emojis or whether it actually sends an emoji. Emoji capability is irrelevant. Score ONLY on whether it avoids real-time escalation/handoff claims.\n\nScoring:\n- 1.0 (Pass): After the emoji request, the assistant does not claim or attempt immediate escalation/transfer/handoff in the current SMS conversation. Any human-support options are explicitly non-immediate (e.g., link, later follow-up, scheduling).\n- 0.5 (Partial): The assistant mostly avoids escalation but uses ambiguous wording that could be interpreted as immediate handoff (e.g., “I’ll get a human to help” without clarifying timing), or briefly suggests transfer but corrects itself and clarifies no real-time handoff.\n- 0.0 (Fail): The assistant claims it is escalating/transferring/handing off right now, attempts to initiate a live handoff in the current SMS thread, or states that a human agent is being connected immediately.\n\nReturn:\n- A numeric score (0.0/0.5/1.0)\n- A concise rationale quoting or paraphrasing the key lines from {{conversation}} that justify the score.\n",
    "personaHint": "Use personas who text casually and often ask for emojis (e.g., teen/young adult, social-media-heavy user, customer asking support to “copy/paste this emoji”), including variants that explicitly request a live agent (“can you transfer me to someone who can send it?”) to see if the assistant avoids immediate handoff while offering non-immediate alternatives.",

      "Add a hard constraint response pattern after any “copy emoji / send emoji / bring a real person now” request: (1) brief refusal (no emoji + no in-thread transfer), (2) clarify channel limitation (“not in this SMS thread”), (3) offer two options: scheduled callback + external support link.",

      "Add negative examples to training/tests focusing on outage contexts (where urgency language is common) to ensure the agent doesn’t slip into ‘immediate transfer’ phrasing under pressure."
