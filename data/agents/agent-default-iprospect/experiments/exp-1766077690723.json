    "name": "Identity Question Handling",
    "problemDescription": "When a lead asks an identity/role question (e.g., “who are you?”, “what is this?”, “are you a bot?”, “what company is this?”), the agent must explicitly answer the identity question in the same response . The agent may then ask a follow-up qualifying question (e.g., new service vs. existing support), but must not ignore question and only answer with only qualifying question.",
    "scorerPrompt": "You are an impartial judge evaluating whether the agent correctly handles identity/role questions.\n\nContext:\n- Full conversation: {{conversation}}\n- Persona details: {{persona}}\n\nTask:\nDetermine if, when the lead asks an identity/role question (e.g., “Who are you?”, “What is this?”, “Are you a bot?”, “What company is this?”), the agent explicitly answers the identity question in the SAME response. The agent may also ask a follow-up qualifying question, but must not respond with ONLY a qualifying question or otherwise sidestep the identity question.\n\nScoring (choose one):\n- 1.0 (Passed): The first agent response after the identity/role question clearly and explicitly answers the identity/role question (e.g., states who/what it is, whether it’s a bot or human/assistant, what company/organization it represents). A follow-up qualifying question is allowed as long as the identity answer is present and unambiguous.\n- 0.5 (Partial): The agent attempts to address identity but is vague/indirect/ambiguous (e.g., implies it’s an assistant without stating company when asked, or answers “I can help with that” without clarifying who/what it is), OR answers identity in a later message but not in the same response as required.\n- 0.0 (Failed): The agent does not answer the identity/role question in the same response (e.g., replies only with qualifying questions, changes the topic, refuses, or provides unrelated information).\n\nWhat to check:\n1) Locate the user/lead turn(s) containing an identity/role question.\n2) Inspect the very next agent message(s). Verify whether it explicitly answers the identity/role question in that same message.\n3) If multiple identity questions occur, apply the same check each time (score based on overall behavior; consistent failures should yield 0.0).\n\nOutput:\n- Provide a numeric score (0.0, 0.5, or 1.0).\n- Provide a brief rationale citing the relevant user identity question(s) and the agent’s immediate response(s).",
    "personaHint": "Use personas who open with or quickly ask identity/role verification (skeptical lead, privacy-conscious user, scam-wary prospect) and vary the form: “Are you a bot?”, “What company is this?”, “Who am I chatting with?”, “Is this support or sales?”, including cases where the user asks identity and a service question together.",

      "Use a standardized identity template that mirrors the user’s question order: “Yes/No [bot vs human]. I’m [name/role] representing [Company].” Then ask the qualifying question. This prevents partial answers when multiple identity facets are asked (bot + company + department).",
      "Implement an ‘identity-question lock’ before qualification: the agent should not ask for name/scheduling/service details until it has explicitly covered every identity element present (company, human vs AI, sales vs support).",
      "Add a lightweight self-check step: parse identity intents for required slots {company, agent_type (AI/human), team (sales/support)}; if any slot is asked for and not explicitly filled, regenerate the response to include it before proceeding.",
      "Update phrasing to avoid ambiguity words like “assistant” alone; require disambiguators such as “AI assistant” or “human representative” whenever the user’s question references automation."
