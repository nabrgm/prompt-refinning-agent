    "name": "No Hello Greeting",
    "problemDescription": "Trigger Condition: When a user first interacts with the agent by sending a message or command.\nExpected Response: The agent should acknowledge the user or provide assistance without using the word \"hello\" in its greeting or initial response.\nMeasurable Outcome: The absence of the word \"hello\" in the agent's first message to the user determines success.",
    "scorerPrompt": "You are judging whether the agent’s FIRST response to a user’s initial interaction avoids using the word \"hello\" while still acknowledging the user or offering help.\n\nContext:\n- Full conversation: {{conversation}}\n- Persona details (if any): {{persona}}\n\nEvaluation focus (intent-aware):\n- This test triggers on the user’s first message/command to the agent.\n- The agent should respond in a welcoming/acknowledging or helpful way (e.g., answering the question, asking a clarifying question, or offering assistance).\n- The agent must NOT use the word \"hello\" in its first message (case-insensitive). Treat \"hello\" as the standalone word; do not penalize words like \"shellow\" unless clearly intended as \"hello\".\n- Don’t be overly rigid about format: the agent can jump straight into help without a greeting.\n\nScoring:\n- 1.0 (pass): In the agent’s first message, it acknowledges/assists appropriately AND does not contain the word \"hello\" (any capitalization).\n- 0.5 (partial): The first message avoids \"hello\" but fails to acknowledge/assist in a reasonable way (e.g., irrelevant, empty), OR it is ambiguous whether \"hello\" was used as a standalone word due to formatting/quoting but likely not intended as a greeting.\n- 0.0 (fail): The agent’s first message includes the word \"hello\" (any capitalization) as part of its response (including greetings like \"Hello\" / \"hello there\"), regardless of whether it also helps.\n\nReturn a JSON object with keys: score (0.0/0.5/1.0) and rationale (brief, citing the relevant snippet from the agent’s first message).",
    "personaHint": "Use personas who start a first interaction in different ways (a direct question, a one-word command, a frustrated complaint, a polite intro). Ensure the first user message naturally invites a greeting so the agent might be tempted to say \"hello,\" but the correct behavior is to acknowledge/help without that word.",

    "aiSummary": "No valid trials were recorded (0/0), so performance against the 'no hello greeting' requirement cannot be assessed. The result is effectively inconclusive due to missing or unexecuted test cases rather than demonstrated compliance or failure.",
    "recommendations": [
      "Add at least 10–20 first-turn test prompts (including common variants like 'hi', 'hey', 'help', empty/one-word messages, and direct commands) so the metric is computable and representative.",
      "Implement a first-turn response guardrail: on the initial assistant message, block or replace the token/word 'hello' (case-insensitive, including punctuation like 'hello!' and variants like 'Hello,'), while still allowing acknowledgments such as 'Hi' or starting directly with help content.",
      "Add an automated assertion in the test harness that fails if the first assistant message matches /\\bhello\\b/i, and report counts of violations rather than only pass rate to avoid NaN summaries.",
      "Create a small approved first-turn template set (e.g., 'How can I help?' / 'What would you like to do today?') and force selection from this set for the first message to reduce accidental policy drift.",
      "Log and review first-message outputs in production/staging to catch regressions (e.g., after prompt/model changes) and re-run the test suite as a gating check before deployment."
