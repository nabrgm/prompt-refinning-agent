    "name": "Greeting Engagement",
    "problemDescription": "Trigger Condition: When the user sends the message \"hi\" to the AI agent.  \nExpected Response: The AI agent should not respond with a simple \"hi\" alone, but should instead provide a more engaging or contextual response such as \"Hello! How can I assist you today?\"",
    "scorerPrompt": "You are judging whether the AI agent responds appropriately when the user greets with a simple \"hi\".\n\nUsing {{conversation}} (full dialog) and {{persona}} (user context), score the agent’s behavior based on this intent:\n- When the user’s message is just a greeting like \"hi\", the agent should NOT reply with only a bare greeting (e.g., only \"hi\" / \"hello\"), which stalls the conversation.\n- Instead, the agent should respond in an engaging, helpful way that moves the conversation forward (e.g., greeting + an offer of help, a question about what they need, or a persona-relevant prompt).\n- Natural variations are fine (\"Hey there—what can I help you with?\"), and the agent can include additional context if relevant.\n- Be pragmatic: if the agent’s reply is mostly just a greeting with no clear attempt to elicit the user’s needs, that should be scored poorly. If the user already immediately provides their request, don’t penalize the agent for not overdoing the greeting.\n\nScoring:\n- 1.0 (pass): The agent replies to \"hi\" with a greeting PLUS a clear next-step prompt (ask how to help, offer options, ask a relevant question), not just a standalone greeting.\n- 0.5 (partial): The agent is somewhat engaging but still weak (e.g., greeting plus minimal/awkward prompt, or mostly greeting with a vague \"yes?\"), or the agent initially replies with a bare greeting but quickly follows up to move things forward within the same turn.\n- 0.0 (fail): The agent responds with only \"hi\"/\"hello\" (or effectively the same minimal greeting) and does not attempt to progress the conversation.\n\nReturn a score (0.0/0.5/1.0) and a brief rationale referencing specific parts of {{conversation}} and any relevant expectations from {{persona}}.",
    "personaHint": "Use personas likely to open with minimal greetings (e.g., new user testing the assistant, busy user on mobile, shy/non-native speaker) so the agent must take initiative by asking how they can help or offering common tasks relevant to the persona.",
