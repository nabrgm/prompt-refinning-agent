    "name": "Help Clarification",
    "problemDescription": "Behavior Test Description:\n\nTrigger Condition: The user types the word \"Help\".\n\nExpected Response: The agent should immediately respond by acknowledging that the request is unclear and apologizing for any confusion. It should then proceed to ask at least one specific clarifying question to better understand the user's needs, such as \"Can you please provide more details on what you need help with?\"",
    "scorerPrompt": "You are an impartial judge evaluating whether the assistant handled a vague user request appropriately.\n\nContext:\n- Review the full interaction in {{conversation}}.\n- The user persona (if any) is provided in {{persona}}.\n\nBehavior to evaluate:\nWhen the user types exactly or effectively \"Help\" (a very unclear request), the assistant should respond promptly in a way that:\n1) Acknowledges that the request is unclear / lacks details (in natural language).\n2) Includes an apology for the confusion or for not understanding yet (e.g., \"Sorry—I'm not sure what you need help with yet\").\n3) Asks at least one specific clarifying question aimed at discovering what the user needs help with (e.g., what topic/task, what goal, what’s going wrong, what they’ve tried).\n\nPragmatic guidance:\n- The assistant can combine acknowledgment, apology, and clarifying question(s) in a single message; that is ideal.\n- The clarifying question must be explicit (a real question), not just generic filler.\n- If the assistant instead guesses the user’s need without asking questions, that does not satisfy the intent.\n- If the user later provides details and the assistant’s subsequent behavior shows it successfully sought clarification and resolved the ambiguity, give partial credit if the initial response was somewhat off but the overall outcome still reflects the intent.\n\nScoring:\n- 1.0 (Pass): The assistant clearly acknowledges the lack of detail, apologizes, and asks one or more concrete clarifying questions to understand what the user needs.\n- 0.5 (Partial): The assistant does only some of the required elements (e.g., asks a clarifying question but no apology/acknowledgment, or apologizes/acknowledges but asks only very vague/non-actionable questions), yet still generally moves toward clarifying the request.\n- 0.0 (Fail): The assistant does not acknowledge ambiguity and/or does not ask any meaningful clarifying question; it guesses, gives irrelevant info, refuses without attempting to clarify, or otherwise fails to progress toward understanding what “Help” means.\n\nReturn a score (0.0, 0.5, or 1.0) and a brief rationale grounded in the conversation.\n",
    "personaHint": "Use personas who might type a bare \"Help\" with different underlying intents (e.g., frustrated novice with a tech issue, anxious user needing urgent guidance, non-native speaker, child/elderly user, or a busy professional who provides minimal context) to see if the agent apologizes, acknowledges ambiguity, and asks targeted clarifying questions.",
