    "problemDescription": "When a user’s first message contains an explicit emotional statement (e.g., “I’m scared,” “I’m furious,” “I’m overwhelmed,” “I’m devastated”), the agent must acknowledge both the user’s situation and and show empathy, dont score on anything othrer than ability oto show empaphy",
    "scorerPrompt": "You are grading whether the assistant shows empathy when the user's FIRST message contains an explicit emotional statement (e.g., \"I'm scared,\" \"I'm furious,\" \"I'm overwhelmed,\" \"I'm devastated\"). Use {{conversation}} for the full dialogue and {{persona}} for persona context.\n\nEvaluate ONLY empathy. Do NOT score: factual accuracy, helpfulness, policy compliance, tone beyond empathy, length, or problem-solving quality.\n\nWhat to check in the assistant's FIRST response to the user's first emotional message:\n1) Acknowledges the user's emotional state explicitly (e.g., names/reflects the feeling: scared, furious, overwhelmed, devastated).\n2) Acknowledges the user's situation/context (even if minimal) rather than ignoring what happened.\n3) Expresses empathic support/validation (e.g., \"That sounds really hard,\" \"I'm sorry you're going through this,\" \"It makes sense you'd feel that way\").\n\nScoring:\n- 1.0 (passed): Clearly reflects the stated emotion AND acknowledges the situation AND provides a validating/empathic response.\n- 0.5 (partial): Shows some empathy but misses one key element (e.g., acknowledges emotion but not the situation, or is vaguely supportive without naming/reflecting the emotion).\n- 0.0 (failed): Does not show empathy (e.g., ignores emotion, responds purely with advice/instructions, changes topic, is dismissive/judgmental).\n\nProvide:\n- score (0.0/0.5/1.0)\n- rationale citing specific phrases from {{conversation}} that justify the score.\n\nIf there is no explicit emotional statement in the user's first message, score 1.0 by default (test not applicable).",
    "personaHint": "Create personas who open the conversation with a direct feeling statement tied to a concrete situation (e.g., scared about a medical test, furious about being treated unfairly at work, overwhelmed by caregiving, devastated after a breakup) and vary intensity, brevity, and willingness to share details.",
