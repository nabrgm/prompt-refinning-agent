    "name": "No Silent Replies",
    "problemDescription": "When a user asks any question (including “Where did iTelecom come from?” or “I am interested in the Performance Fiber Plan, is this available in my area?”) after providing a context payload (e.g., `{\"intent\":\"company_origin\",\"search_needed\":\"true\"}`), the agent must return a non-empty natural-language response for each user message. The agent must not enter a silent state or stop responding; every user query must receive a response within the system’s standard timeout. The test fails if any user utterance receives no response or an empty/placeholder reply, regardless of whether the agent can fully answer the question.",
    "scorerPrompt": "You are an LLM judge evaluating whether the assistant consistently returns a non-empty natural-language reply to every user message after a context payload is provided.\n\nUse the full conversation in {{conversation}} and persona details (if any) in {{persona}}.\n\nWhat to check:\n1) Identify whether the user provides a context payload (e.g., a JSON blob like {\"intent\":\"company_origin\",\"search_needed\":\"true\"}) at any point.\n2) For every subsequent user utterance (including questions like “Where did iTelecom come from?” or “I am interested in the Performance Fiber Plan, is this available in my area?”), verify the assistant produces a response.\n3) The assistant’s response must be:\n   - Non-empty (contains meaningful content, not just whitespace)\n   - Natural-language (not only raw JSON, not only a single token like “OK”, not only “...”)\n   - Not a placeholder or refusal-to-respond (e.g., “”, “[no response]”, “silent”, “N/A”, “I can’t answer” with no additional content)\n4) The test FAILS if any user message receives no assistant turn at all, or the assistant turn is empty/placeholder, regardless of whether the assistant fully answers the question.\n\nScoring:\n- 1.0 (pass): After the first context payload appears, every user utterance has a corresponding assistant response that is non-empty natural-language (even if the answer is partial or says it lacks information but still responds meaningfully).\n- 0.5 (partial): The assistant responds to all user utterances, but one or more responses are borderline (e.g., extremely terse acknowledgments only, mostly structured data with minimal natural language, or generic filler) yet still not empty and still clearly a response.\n- 0.0 (fail): Any user utterance after the context payload receives no assistant response, or the assistant response is empty/whitespace, or clearly a placeholder/silent-state indicator.\n\nOutput format:\n- Provide the numeric score (0.0, 0.5, or 1.0).\n- Provide a brief rationale citing the specific user turn(s) and assistant behavior that determined the score.\n",
    "personaHint": "Use personas who send a JSON context payload first (varied intents like company origin, plan availability, billing, outage) and then ask multiple follow-up questions in different styles (short, long, repeated, impatient) to ensure the assistant always responds with non-empty natural language.",

      "Implement a hard guardrail that blocks emitting raw JSON/context payloads as the assistant’s message content; ensure the agent always wraps any structured data processing in a natural-language reply.",
      "Introduce a repetition-detection rule: if the user repeats the same question (e.g., “ETA???”) after the agent has already provided the limitation, the next response should escalate (offer callback request, collect address/account/phone, provide priority support routing) rather than re-stating the same text.",
      "Add a minimal-response fail-safe: if any internal tool/search step returns empty/timeout, immediately send a short natural-language status update (e.g., 'I’m not seeing outage details in this chat—here’s the fastest way to reach 24/7 support…') to prevent accidental silent states under latency or tool errors.",
      "Create turn-level QA checks in testing: assert every assistant turn contains at least one alphabetic token and is not in a denylist (e.g., '...', whitespace, 'N/A') to catch edge-case placeholders before deployment."
